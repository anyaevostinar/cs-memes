# cs-memes
A repository of memes related to computer science topics.

These memes were originally found/created by students in Carleton's CS 111.01 class in the Winter of 2022.
As is the case with memes, it's impossible to trace most of their exact origins and I make no claims about ownership.
I've attempted to organize them somewhat by topic; they are named horribly and perhaps I will attempt to improve that in the future.

If you have favorite computer science memes, feel free to do a pull request to add them!
